🧰 Final Updated Python Toolbox Project – 8 Refined Objectives
 Objective 1: Smart Data Cleaning using Pandas
 Topics Covered: Pandas, Data Cleaning
Goal: Handle missing values, duplicates, and fix inconsistent formats.
Visualization: Heatmap of missing data using Seaborn

 Objective 2: Summary Statistics and Distribution Analysis
 Topics Covered: NumPy, Summary Stats
Goal: Use NumPy to compute mean, median, std dev for Sales and Profit.
 Visualization: Seaborn histogram with KDE overlay

Objective 3: Customized Sales Visualization using Matplotlib
Topics Covered: Matplotlib, Grouping, Customization
Goal: Visualize total sales by Region and Category with full styling.
Visualization: Grouped bar plot with labels, color palette, legends

 Objective 4: Interactive Profit vs. Sales Analysis with Category & Region Segmentation
🎯 Goal:
Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between Sales and Profit, with visual cues:

Hue (color) for Region

Style/Shape for Category

Size for Quantity 

 Objective 5: Heatmap Analysis for Correlation & Trends
 Topics Covered: Correlation, Seaborn Heatmap
 Goal: Create correlation matrix of numerical columns and visualize using heatmap.
 Visualization: Correlation heatmap with annotations

 Objective 6: Statistical Hypothesis Testing – Z-test, t-test, p-test
 Topics Covered: Z-test, t-test, p-values
 Goal: Compare average Sales/Profit between two regions/categories
Visualization: Bar plot with test results annotated

 Objective 7: Chi-Squared Test between Category and Region
We’ll test if there's a significant association between Product Category and Region — a valid categorical test, and it fits your dataset.
